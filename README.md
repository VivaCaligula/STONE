# The Philosopher's Stone

Stone is a simple English-to-formal-logic converter. It will take any block of English text (a single sentence or a whole book) and convert it to its first-order symbolic form, annotate the symbolic text, print truth tables, and highlight invalid lines. When finished, it will also be able to produce entire blocks of English text given input formats. This will allow for entire chapters or books to be generated that follow an *exact* logical format, with the argument spread across 2,000 pages if desired. Whether the argument is valid or invalid is up to the discretion of the user (and of course this can be used for dubious reasons).

The current instantiation of this code can be found [here](https://snerx.com/stone "stone").
